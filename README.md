# Amazon Cloud Drive SDK

Alex node-clouddrive is greate but provides no documented SDK f√ºr the cloud drive. The goal of this fork is to make such an documented SDK

## Further planned features

- typescript wrapper
- auth with firebase of others

# Amazon Cloud Drive CLI and SDK

Amazon's Cloud Drive offers unlimited cloud storage but no good way to interact with your data (upload, download, find, etc). The web app is lacking and the desktop app is sub-par. So here's a command-line interface and SDK for interacting with Cloud Drive as if it were a filesystem.

## Install

```
npm install -g clouddrive
```

## Usage

### Initial Authorization

Before using the CLI, the config values for the application will need to be set. Use the `config` command to view and set the available options.

```
$ clouddrive config
auth.email           =
auth.id              =
auth.secret          =
cli.colors           = true
cli.ignoreFiles      = ^(\.DS_Store|[Tt]humbs.db)$
cli.progressBars     = true
cli.progressInterval = 250
cli.timestamp        = false
database.driver      = sqlite
database.host        = 127.0.0.1
database.database    = clouddrive
database.username    = root
database.password    =
display.date         = modified
display.showPending  = true
display.showTrash    = true
download.checkMd5    = true
json.pretty          = false
log.file             =
log.level            = info
sync.chunkSize       =
sync.maxNodes        =
upload.duplicates    = false
upload.checkMd5      = false
upload.numRetries    = 1

$ clouddrive config auth.email me@example.com
email saved
```

You will need to set the `email` for the Amazon account you wish to use with the CLI. The first run of the application will require you to run `clouddrive init` to authorize the CLI with your Amazon account. This will open a browser and take you to Amazon for authorization. After authorization, your access token will be printed in the browser. Simply copy and paste this back into the terminal.

Optionally, if you'd like to use your own Amazon Cloud Drive credentials, set the `auth.client-id` and `auth.client-secret` options using the `config` command.

```
$ clouddrive init
Initializing...
Initial authorization is required
https://www.amazon.com/ap/oa?client_id=...
? url:
```

Naviage to the URL displayed to to authorize the app with your Cloud Drive account using your credentials. This will redirect your browser to a new URL: paste that URL back into the prompt.

### Syncing

The first time you run the CLI (after initialization), you will need to (and periodically after the initial sync) run the `sync` command to pull down any Cloud Drive changes to the local cache. This local cache is required for the CLI to work and speeds up reading information when 'browsing' Cloud Drive using the CLI. This also makes many commands available for offline use.

```
$ clouddrive sync
```

### Commands

The CLI makes interacting with Cloud Drive feel like using a remote filesystem with commands such as `ls`, `du`, `mkdir`, etc.

### config

The `config` command is used for reading, writing, and resetting config values for the CLI. The following options are available:
- `auth.email`: The email to use with the CLI
- `auth.id`: Custom Amazon API credentials if you would like to use your own
- `auth.secret`: Custom Amazon API credentials if you would like to use your own
- `cli.colors`: ANSI color output
- `cli.progressBars`: Display or suppress progress bars
- `database.driver`: Database type to use for the local cache (`sqlite`, `mysql`, or `mongo`)
- `database.host`: Host/IP the database exists on (if not SQLite)
- `database.database`: Database to use (MySQL)
- `database.username`: Database username for authentication
- `database.password`: Database password for authentication
- `display.date`: Display either `modified` or `created` date when listing nodes
- `display.showPending`: Toggle displaying of `PENDING` nodes with `ls` command
- `display.showTrash`: Toggle display of `TRASH` nodes with the `ls` command
- `download.checkMd5`: Perform or suppress MD5 check when downloading files
- `json.pretty`: Whether to format JSON output or not
- `upload.duplicates`: Allow duplicate files to be uploaded to Cloud Drive
- `upload.retryAttempt`: Number of attempts to upload a file

### ls

The `ls` command allows you to view the contents of a folder. If you don't provide a remote path argument, it will display the contents at the root directory. The output provides detailed information for each item including the remote ID, its modified date (or created if you change the config), its status (`AVAILABLE`, `TRASH`), its type (`FILE` or `FOLDER`), its size, and its name.

You can also provide a node's ID instead of path for the `ls` argument by using the `-i` flag.

```
$ clouddrive ls
1234564789  Nov   8 15:20  AVAILABLE  FOLDER  0B     Documents
0123456829  Mar  30  8:35  AVAILABLE  FOLDER  0B     Pictures
8723457923  Aug  23 15:39  TRASH      FILE    0B     test.txt
```

### du

The `du` command will output the total size used by the given file or folder, recursively. Again, if no argument is given, it will calculate the entire used space of your entire Cloud Drive. Passing the `-i` flag will calculate the size of the node by its ID instead of its path. It will also output the total files and folders contained in the path.

```
$ clouddrive du
174.77MB
3 files, 1 folders
```

### upload

The `upload` command lets you upload files and folders (recursively) to Amazon. Simply pass an arbitrary number of local paths (globbing is supported) and the last argument must be the remote folder to upload the files to. If you want to upload to the top-level directory, simply pass in `/` as the last parameter.

```
$ clouddrive upload ./test/* /
```

### download

In addition to uploading files, the `download` command allows you to retrieve files you've uploaded to Amazon. The first parameter is the file or folder (recursively) you want to download. The second (optional) parameter is the location and/or filename to save the file as. If no path is given, the remote node is downloaded to the current working directory with the same name as it exists remotely.

```
$ clouddrive download /test/ .
```
